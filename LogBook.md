# Spring Master Test Drives Log Book

<ins>2021/05/22</ins>

Welcome to [JEOrg Spring Master Test Drives](https://github.com/jesperancinha/jeorg-spring-master-test-drives).   
In these series we will only have master projects available. We won't be looking at the basics of Spring 5.   
That will still occur in my other repo: [JEOrg Spring 5 Test Drives](https://github.com/jesperancinha/jeorg-spring-5-test-drives).

The setting in this repo is essentially about details.   
So for example if we are looking at a `@Transactional` annotation, we won't just be looking at what a `@Transactional` does.   
Further, we will be looking at what each single parameter of `@Transactional` actually does.

Please use this repo for your studies only if you already have enough baggage from the Spring Framework. We will avoid paying attention to basic Spring concepts.

Please have a look at our page where the description of the in-depth subjects investigated and related web resources are provided: [Technology](./Technology.md).

Also, please check our [Reminders](dev/src/jofisaes/jeorg-spring-master-test-drives/docs/reminders/Reminders.md) page, where short descriptions are presented in a flash card fashion for specific theoretical aspects of the Spring Framework.

We all know, in a way, what Spring Boot is, but sometimes it is very important to explain what it actually is. Find more in our [Spring Boot](dev/src/jofisaes/jeorg-spring-master-test-drives/docs/reminders/SpringBoot.md) section.
